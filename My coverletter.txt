Cover letter
Hi ,
I’m excited to apply for this project. I have extensive experience integrating OpenAI’s GPT models with automation platforms like Make.com and ActiveCampaign, and I’ve successfully completed a similar project that automatically audits websites using client-submitted URLs, generates reports with ChatGPT, and delivers them via email.

Why I'm a Strong Fit
• ChatGPT Integrations: I’ve built multiple systems that pull data from structured and unstructured URLs (e.g., Airbnb, Booking.com) and turn it into customized summaries using GPT-4.
• Automation Expertise: I’m highly skilled with Make.com for end-to-end automation – from webhook triggers, data parsing, to report delivery.
• Email Systems: Integrated ActiveCampaign for email sequencing, dynamic personalization, and automated file delivery.
• UX/Workflow Design: I build flows with simplicity, aiming for zero-friction client interaction.

How the System Will Work
1. Input Submission: User submits a form with a URL.
2. URL Scraping and AI Analysis: A script fetches key content and feeds it to ChatGPT via API.
3. Template Mapping: The AI fills in a pre-defined audit report format.
4. Formatting: Generated content is styled using your branding (HTML/PDF).
5. Automation: Make.com handles the workflow – webhook → ChatGPT → template → ActiveCampaign → email delivery.


Previous Project Highlight
I recently delivered a project for a digital marketing agency where users submitted competitor URLs. The system automatically:
• Scraped key metrics
• Used GPT to create side-by-side comparison reports
• Styled them in PDF with company branding
• Delivered reports via Make.com and Gmail API
The client saw a 60% time reduction in generating custom audits.

Deliverables
• End-to-end AI pipeline with ChatGPT and automation
• Fully working audit template integration
• Branded PDF or HTML reports
• Make.com scenario with ActiveCampaign integration
• Deployment, documentation, and optimization

I’m confident I can take this project forward and deliver results quickly and effectively. Let’s schedule a time to connect and discuss next steps.
Thank you,
Vitalii
